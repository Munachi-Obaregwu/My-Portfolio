                    <h3>Why I like fries with fish and sauce</h3>
                    <p>Fries and fish is so delicious, the combination of crispy fries and tender fish is such a great texture. The saltiness of the fries just makes the fish's mild flavor so better. Another factor is the procedure, it doesn't need special knowledge or deep thinking or drastic measurements that must be followed and can be prepared in just about 40 (fourty) minutes to 1 (one) hour. Also, the way it can go with almost every sauce is just so beneficial.</p>

                    <h3>How to prepare fries with fish and sauce</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To prepare fries with fish, you'll need:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Fish</li>
                                <li>Potatoes</li>

                                <li>Yams</li>
                                <li>Salt</li>
                                <li>Groundnut Oil</li>
                                <li>Water</li>
                                <li>Spices you may like</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>Then you peel the yams, potatoes and plantain you want to fry.</li>
                        <li>Slice  all of them to your desired shape.</li>
                        <li>Heat up the frying pan.</li>
                        <li>While the frying pan is heating up, get your fish and wash it.</li>
                        <li>Then, you slice it to your desired quantity and keep it aside.</li>
                        <li>By now, the frying pan should be hot, to check, pour a bit of water into the frying pan, if it evaporates quickly it is hot enough, if not wait a bit.</li>
                        <li>Then, you clean up any trace of water on the frying pan and carefully pour groundnut oil into the frying pan.</li>
                        <li>Then slowly and carefully dip either a piece of yam or potato or plantain or fish (whichever one you prefer) into the frying pan.</li>
                        <li>After some minutes, turn all of them over, fry until golden brown (be careful of splashes from the oil).</li>
                        <li>You may add salt and other spices to your taste and you have just prepared fries with fish.</li>
                        <li>And you have prepared fries and fish with sauce.</li>

                    <h3>Why I like Jollof Rice and Chicken</h3>
                    <p>I just love Jollof Rice and Chicken so much, the combination of the taste of pepper from the rice and the taste of meat is just so divine. The way the rice is so soft and the chicken is somewhere between hard and soft is just heavenly. And when you eat the two of them together i.e., the rice and chicken the taste you get from the two of them is just too good. The sublime mixture of oil from the chicken and all the combination of tastes from the jollof rice, will make you feel like drooling. Again, I don't think I am the only one who would agree that jollof rice is widely known as a favourite meal. There is almost no ocassion you will go to and you won't see jollof rice on their menu, not only because it is simple to cook but also because it takes little time to cook (incase of emergency food).</p>
